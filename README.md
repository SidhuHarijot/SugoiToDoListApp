- **Installed RAM**: 16.0 GB (15.2 GB usable)
- **System Type**: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
- **Windows**: Windows 11 Home Single Language
- **Version**: 22H2
- **OS Build**: 22621.3007
- **Graphics**: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU

# Installation Instructions

## Node.js and npm

### Downloading Node.js:
- Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en) to download the Long Term Support (LTS) version. The LTS version is recommended for its stability and long-term support.
- Choose the Windows Installer (.msi) option, selecting the 64-bit version to match the system requirements.

### Installing Node.js:
- Run the downloaded installer, following the on-screen instructions. The installer will set up both Node.js and npm on your system.
- Opt for the default installation settings to ensure all necessary components are installed, including npm.

### Verifying the Installation:
- To confirm that Node.js and npm are correctly installed, open a command prompt and enter:
    ```
    node -v 
    npm -v 
    ```
- This command displays the installed version of Node.js and npm. Successful installation is indicated by the version numbers being displayed.

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Downloading JDK 17:
- Access the [Oracle's JDK 17 archive page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html). JDK 17 is chosen for its compatibility with Android development tools.
- Select the Windows x64 Installer (.msi file) for download, ensuring compatibility with the system's architecture.

### Installing JDK 17:
- Execute the downloaded MSI installer, following the prompts to install JDK on your system. The default installation options should suffice for most development needs.

## Android Studio and SDK

### Installing Android Studio:
- Download Android Studio from the [official download page](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Launch the downloaded installer, selecting options to install Android Studio along with the Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android Virtual Device for emulating Android devices.
- This build is using Android 14 and Build API tools 34.

# Configuration Steps

## Setting Environment Variables
Environment variables such as ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME are crucial for development tools to locate the Android SDK and JDK installations on your system.

- **ANDROID_HOME**: This variable points to the location of your Android SDK. The default path is usually `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`.
- **JAVA_HOME**: Set this variable to the path where JDK 17 is installed, facilitating tools to find the Java compiler and other utilities.

To set these environment variables:
1. Open the System Properties dialog by right-clicking on 'This PC' and selecting 'Properties' â†’ 'Advanced system settings.'
2. Click on 'Environment Variables.'
3. Under 'System Variables,' click 'New' to add JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME variables, providing the respective paths to JDK and Android SDK installations.
4. To modify the 'Path' variable, add the path to the platform-tools directory within the Android SDK installation path. This allows access to Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and other platform tools from the command line.

## Changing Gradle Version:
1. Navigate to android > gradle > wrapper and open gradle-wrapper file. 
2. Change the 8.3 in the value of distributionUrl to 8.5 or whatever version you want to.

# Creating and Running the React Native Project

## Project Initialization:
- Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the "SugoiToDoListApp."
- Initialize the project with React Native CLI using:
    ```
    npx react-native@latest init SugoiToDoListApp 
    ```
- This command creates a new directory named "SugoiToDoListApp" with all the necessary React Native files and dependencies.

## Running the Project on a Physical Android Device:
- Connect your Android device to the computer via USB, ensuring USB debugging is enabled on the device.
- Verify the device connection by running adb devices. Your device should be listed under "Connected devices."
- Navigate to the project directory and start the application with:
    ```
    npm start 
    ```
- In a new command prompt window, execute:
    ```
    npm run android 
    ```
- This compiles the React Native app and installs it on the connected Android device.

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Android Development Environment Error**: If you encounter an error indicating that the Android development environment is not correctly set up, particularly after executing `npm run android`, check the following:
  - Verify that `JAVA_HOME` is correctly set, pointing to the JDK installation path.
  - Ensure the Android SDK path is correctly specified in `ANDROID_HOME` and that the SDK version matches the project's requirements.

- **Java Version Error**: For errors related to the Android Gradle plugin requiring a specific Java version, consult the following resources for guidance on configuring your development environment to use the correct Java version:
